### Homogeneous Data Structures

* 1 Dimension - Atomic Vector
* 2 Dimension - Matrix
* N Dimension - Array

### Heterogenous Data Structures

* 1 Dimension - List
* 2 Dimension - Data Frame


## Datatypes 
* Logical Variable - True / False
* Integer- eg :4L, 10L
* Double(numeric)- 4(4.0), 10(10.0)


## Missing Value
